# Wedding Photo Booth

This is a DIY approach to a photobooth for my personal wedding.

It includes

- A web-based viewfinder to take the picture
- Automatically saving the photo for the bride and groom 
- The ability to email the photo to an arbitrary email
- The ability to print the photo to a Canon Ivy printer
- The ability to print an overlayed version of the photo to a second Canon Ivy printer as part of a mosaic
